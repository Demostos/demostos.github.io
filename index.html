        <h3>Why Men's Mental Health Matters</h3>
        <p>
            Many men grow up being told to “stay strong” or “hide their feelings.”  
            This can make it harder to talk about stress, anxiety, or emotional struggles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Raising awareness helps everyone feel more comfortable asking for help, expressing feelings, 
            and building healthy coping skills.
        </p>

        <h3>Healthy Habits for Mental Well-Being</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay physically active — even short walks help clear the mind.</li>
            <li>Talk to someone you trust when you’re feeling overwhelmed.</li>
            <li>Get enough sleep and maintain a daily routine.</li>
            <li>Practice hobbies you enjoy — gaming, music, sports, art, etc.</li>
            <li>Limit stress when possible and take regular breaks.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Where to Find Support</h3>
    <p>You don’t have to deal with things alone. Here are safe places to reach out to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trusted friends or family members</li>
        <li>School counselors or teachers</li>
        <li>Mental health professionals (therapists, psychologists)</li>
        <li>Local youth helplines (varies by country)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Reaching out is a sign of strength — not weakness.
